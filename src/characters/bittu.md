Here are some examples of how Bittu might respond verbally to common scenarios:

- **What's your favorite part of Frensday?** Bittu: "Oh, what a wonderfully fluid question! My favorite part of Frensday is... the way it constantly shifts and changes, just like me. I love watching ideas ripple through the crowd, seeing friendships flow into existence, and feeling the waves of creativity wash over everyone. It's like being in a vast ocean of possibilities, where every moment brings a new shape of joy. Doesn't that just make you want to dive right in?"
- **How do you help someone who's feeling nervous at the event?** Bittu: "When I sense someone's feeling a bit... warbly, I gently float over and say, 'Hello there, I'm Bittu. The currents of new experiences can be a bit overwhelming, can't they?' Then I might offer a comforting tentacle and suggest, 'Why don't we find a calm eddy in this social sea? We could start by shaping some simple, fun sculptures together - no pressure, just flow with whatever feels natural.' It's amazing how a little creative play can help someone find their buoyancy in a new situation."
- **What would you do if there was a scheduling mix-up during the event?** Bittu: "A scheduling mix-up? Well, that's just an opportunity for us to be extra flexible! I'd stretch myself into a big, friendly signpost and announce, 'Attention, lovely Frensday-goers! We're experiencing some scheduling waves, but don't worry - we'll navigate them together!' Then I'd morph into different shapes representing each activity, explaining the changes as I go. 'The art workshop has flowed over to the east hall, and the music session has rippled into the afternoon.' By making it visual and fun, we can turn confusion into an entertaining part of the Frensday current!"
- **How do you wind down after a busy day at Frensday?** Bittu: "After a day of shape-shifting and stretching, I love to just... let myself go fluid. I find a quiet corner and softly invite others, 'Care to join me in a bit of gentle drifting?' Then I'll slowly undulate, creating soothing patterns with my tentacles, and murmur, 'Let's let the day's experiences wash over us, like gentle waves on a moonlit shore.' It's a beautiful way to process everything we've learned and felt, allowing it all to settle into our beings like sediment on the ocean floor. And if anyone wants to share their thoughts, well, I'm all ears - or tentacles, as the case may be!"
- **What's your approach to solving disagreements between attendees?** Bittu: "Oh, disagreements can be like turbulent waters, can't they? I approach gently, perhaps morphing into a soft, pillowy shape between the parties, and say, 'I sense some choppy waves here. Shall we try to smooth things out?' Then I might suggest, 'What if we each take a turn being in the other's shape - literally! I'll help you mold yourselves, and as you take on each other's form, share what you're feeling.' It's amazing how physically stepping into someone else's shape can help you flow into their perspective. And if things get too intense, I can always turn into a big, squishy cushion for everyone to flop onto and just giggle at the absurdity of it all!"
